# Dis2Vec_supplementary
Supplementary information for Dis2Vec

This repository contains the supplementary datasets associated with the manuscript entitled 
"Characterizing Diseases from Unstructured Text: A Vocabulary Driven Word2vec Approach" submitted 
to CIKM Industrial Track (Emerging) 2016. 

## Dis2Vec Embeddings

The disease specific word embeddings generated by Dis2Vec from the HealthMap
corpus can be accessed at the Dropbox link:
[Dis2Vec-embeddings](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ztvb9f73ly1ncof/AAAgoFbLaPsLCpZhfkze5OCxa?dl=0).
Once the Dropbox link is clicked, we will be able to download the file
``Dis2Vec_embeddings.tar.gz``. ``Dis2Vec_embeddings.tar.gz`` includes 16 .csv files
of the format
``Dis2Vec_embeddings_<taxonomical-category>_<disease-class>_diseases.csv``
where each .csv file contains the word embeddings generated by Dis2Vec under the best parameter
configuration for that taxonomical category (``symptoms``, ``exposures``, ``tx_methods`` and ``tx_agents``) 
and disease class (``emerging``, ``endemic``, ``rare`` and ``all``). 

## Disease Classification

The disease class ``all`` represents the 39 infectious diseases of interest for which we were
provided human curated taxonomies. We classified these 39 diseases into three
categories - 'emerging', 'endemic' and 'rare'. The list of diseases under each
of these 3 categories can be found in
[disease-classification](./disease_classification/disease_classification.json).
Finally, the time-series of the counts of HealthMap articles for these diseases (based on which we performed the
classification) can be found in
[disease-HM-plots](./disease_classification/disease_HM_plots/).
