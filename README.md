## Disease Classification

We classified these 39 diseases into three
categories - ``emerging``, ``endemic`` and ``rare``. The list of diseases under each
of these 3 categories can be found in
[disease-classification](./disease_classification/disease_classification.json).
Finally, the time-series of the counts of HealthMap articles for these diseases (based on which we performed the
classification) can be found in
[disease-HM-plots](./disease_classification/disease_HM_plots/). For more
details on the classification process, please see [Dis2Vec-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00106.pdf).
