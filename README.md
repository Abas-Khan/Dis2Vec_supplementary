# Dis2Vec_supplementary
Supplementary information for Dis2Vec

This repository contains the supplementary datasets associated with the manuscript entitled 
``Characterizing Diseases from Unstructured Text: A Vocabulary Driven Word2vec Approach`` submitted 
to CIKM Industrial Track (Emerging) 2016. The manuscript can be accessed at
[Dis2Vec-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00106.pdf). 

## Dis2Vec Embeddings

The disease specific word embeddings generated by Dis2Vec from the HealthMap
corpus can be accessed at the Dropbox link:
[Dis2Vec-embeddings](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ztvb9f73ly1ncof/AAAgoFbLaPsLCpZhfkze5OCxa?dl=0).
Once the Dropbox link is clicked, we will be able to download 16 .bin files
of the format ``Dis2Vec_embeddings_<taxonomical-category>_<disease-class>_diseases.bin``
where each .bin file contains the word embeddings generated by Dis2Vec under the best parameter
configuration which achieved highest characterization accuracy (equation 8 in [Dis2Vec-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00106.pdf)) 
for that taxonomical category (``symptoms``, ``exposures``, ``tx_methods`` and ``tx_agents``) and disease class (``emerging``, ``endemic``, ``rare`` and ``all``).
To extract the embeddings from a .bin file, you have to install the gensim
package in python and perform the following steps.

* ``>> from gensim.models import word2vec`` 
* ``>> model_Dis2Vec = word2vec.Word2vec.load_word2vec_format("Dis2Vec_embeddings_symptoms_rare_diseases.bin", binary=True, unicode_errors='ignore')``

To extract the embedding for any word, say ``salmonella``, we have to perform the following step.

``>> model_Dis2Vec["salmonella"]``




## Disease Classification

The disease class ``all`` represents the 39 infectious diseases of interest for which we were
provided human curated taxonomies. We classified these 39 diseases into three
categories - ``emerging``, ``endemic`` and ``rare``. The list of diseases under each
of these 3 categories can be found in
[disease-classification](./disease_classification/disease_classification.json).
Finally, the time-series of the counts of HealthMap articles for these diseases (based on which we performed the
classification) can be found in
[disease-HM-plots](./disease_classification/disease_HM_plots/). For more
details on the classification process, please see [Dis2Vec-pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00106.pdf).
